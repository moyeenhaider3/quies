      Last updated: February 16, 2026
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Quies ("we", "our", "the app") is a free, ad-supported mobile application
      developed by Moyeen Haider. This Privacy Policy explains what information
      is collected, how it is used, and your choices regarding your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using Quies, you agree to the collection and use of information as
      described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
    <p>
      Quies stores the following data locally on your device using on-device
      storage (Hive). This data <strong>never leaves your device</strong> and is
      not transmitted to any server:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your mood selections and preferences</li>
      <li>Bookmarked quotes</li>
      <li>Theme and display settings</li>
      <li>Onboarding progress</li>
      <li>Music playback preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not have access to this data. It exists only on your device and is
      removed when you uninstall the app or clear app data.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Collected by Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements within the
      app. AdMob may collect and process certain data automatically, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device advertising identifier (Advertising ID / IDFA)</li>
      <li>IP address (used for approximate geographic ad targeting)</li>
      <li>Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks, views)</li>
      <li>Device information (model, OS version, screen size)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is collected and processed by Google according to their
      policies. For details, see
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>
      and
      <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543"
        >How Google uses data from apps that use their services</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>No Account Required</h2>
    <p>
      Quies does not require you to create an account. We do not collect your
      name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable
      information.
    </p>

    <h2>No Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      Quies does not use analytics services such as Firebase Analytics, Google
      Analytics, Mixpanel, or any similar tracking tools. We do not track how
      you use the app beyond the standard ad interaction data collected by
      AdMob.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      Quies is a free app that displays advertisements through Google AdMob.
      These ads help support the development and maintenance of the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the European Economic Area (EEA) and other regions where required by
      law, a consent dialog is presented when you first use the app, allowing
      you to choose whether to receive personalized or non-personalized
      advertisements.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take data security seriously:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All network communications (API requests, ad serving) use HTTPS
        encryption
      </li>
      <li>
        Local data is stored on your device and protected by your device's
        built-in security features
      </li>
      <li>We do not operate servers that store your personal data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Quies is rated for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in
      your jurisdiction). If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child
      has provided personal information through the app, please contact us so we
      can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>

    <h3>For Users in the European Economic Area (GDPR)</h3>
    <p>If you are located in the EEA, you have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Consent management:</strong> You can manage your ad
        personalization preferences through the consent dialog shown in the app
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data deletion:</strong> You can delete all locally stored data
        by clearing app data in your device's Settings, or by uninstalling the
        app
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Opt out of personalized ads:</strong> You can opt out via the
        consent dialog or by resetting your device's advertising ID
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contact us:</strong> You may contact us regarding any data
        rights concerns
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Users in California (CCPA)</h3>
    <p>
      California residents have the right to know what data is collected and to
      request deletion. As Quies stores data only on your device, you can
      exercise these rights by clearing app data or uninstalling the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Local data (preferences, bookmarks) is retained on your device until you
      clear app data or uninstall Quies. We do not retain any data on external
      servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data collected by Google AdMob is retained according to
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/retention"
        >Google's data retention policies</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you
      to review this page periodically.
